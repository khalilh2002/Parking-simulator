# Parking Simulator

## Overview

The **Parking Simulator** is a desktop application built using **Java Swing**. This application provides an interactive interface for simulating parking lot operations, including vehicle entry, exit, and tracking available parking spaces. The project demonstrates the use of Java Swing for GUI design and simulates real-world parking management.
